# UNO CARDS DETECTION USING YOLOV5 


### OVERVIEW : 
The purpose of this project is to create a Deep Learning model that detect the Uno cards . My model is based on YOLO's object detection algorithm, and I'm using the dataset from Roboflow website.



 ## üìÅDATA COLLECTION:
 
**UNO DETECTION**: **https://universe.roboflow.com/dtcinfotech-eyt5v/uno-sajey**
  
 ## BUSINESS CASE:TO BUILD A SYSTEM FOR DETECTING THE UNO CARDS FOR GIVING THE IMAGES

**The dataset consists of 14  classes:**
nc: 14
names: ['0', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']

# WORKFLOW:
  ## Data Preparation:
  * Total 200 images for training and for validation present in 14 classes.
  * Create a bounding boxes with the help of label-img And makesense.ai website according to YoloV5.
  * Prepare folder structure that can be accept by YoloV5.

## STEPS TO USE YOLOV5: 
* Cloning the YoloV5 file from official repository.
* Changing the directory of yolov5
* Installing the dependencies
* Download all versions pre-trained weights.

 ## STEPS BEFORE TRAINING CUSTOM DATASET :
* Go to yolov5/data/.
* Open data.yaml
* Edit the following inside it:

 1. Training and Validation file path
 2. Number of classes and Class names.

  ## TRAINING YOLOV5 MODEL:
* Set images size 640 with batch of 8.
* Train model around 600 epochs .
* Visualise the training metrics with the help of tensorboard.
